# Goga &ndash; Go Evolutionary Algorithm

Goga implements structures and routines for the development of Evolutionary Algorithms. The goal of
this library is to handle integer- float-point- and mixed-type representations. The origin of the
name is related to genetic algorithms; but the code does not employ genetic operators any longer.
Differential Evolution is used instead.
